dependencies
------------

* tested with python 2.7.3, bitcoind 0.9.2.1
* jgarzik's bitcoinrpc library (https://github.com/jgarzik/python-bitcoinrpc)
* (Windows only) ncurses library (http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#curses)

features
--------

* updating ticker showing bitcoind's status (via RPC)
* view arbitrary block contents quickly
* facility to view transactions in current block and trace back through their inputs (with -txindex)
* view transactions from your wallet - txid, amounts, cumulative balance
* view connected peers
* basic debug console functionality (only for testnet use at present)

usage
-----

copy your bitcoin.conf to bitcoind-ncurses's folder

alternatively, create a file with the following details:
```
rpcuser=xxx
rpcpassword=yyy
testnet=0
```

if you are running bitcoin-qt instead of bitcoind, you must also add the following details
```
server=1
```

this is an early development release. expect (safe) breakage

launch
------

replace 'python' with 'python2' if you also have python3 installed.
```
$ python main.py
$ python main.py -c some_other_config_file.conf
```

todo
----

* ensure terminal always returns to sane state on program exit
* mean block size/tx count over last X blocks
* fee estimation / fee data
* bandwidth chart
* transaction creation support (if I feel suicidal)
* more testing for edge cases (paramount for above)

found bitcoind-ncurses useful? donations are your way of showing that!

my main machine is currently a 6 year old Atom laptop. upgrading that would be rather useful. cheers!
